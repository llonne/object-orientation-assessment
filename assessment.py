Part 1: Discussion

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.
   - Abstraction: Allows you to obscure all but the relevant data about an object
        to reduce complexity and repetition, and increase efficiency.
   - Encapsulation: You don't need to know/understand details in the code to use it.
   - Polymorphism: You can use the same simple method for accessing differing
        (possibly more complex) underlying data. Often using class inheritance.

2. What is a class?
    - An object that lets you structure your software to add consistency
    to your programs so that they can be used in a cleaner way.

3. What is an instance attribute?
    - Instance attributes only apply to the specific instance of a class.

4. What is a method?
    - A method is a function which is a member of a class.

5. What is an instance in object orientation?
    - A specific realization of any class. You must instantiate a class to use its instance.

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
    - Class attributes are same for all instances of class.
    - Instance attributes only apply to the individual instance of a class.

   Give an example of when you might use each.

class(Cat):
    sound = purr # class attribute
fluffy = Cat()
fluffy.name = "fluffy" # instance attribute
